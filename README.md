✅ Tips

    Ensure all ODrive boards are detected via CAN and show green indicators.

    Check topics using:

    Visualize the robot and map using:

# 🤖 Jetson Orin Nano Robot Setup (ODrive + CAN + ROS 2 + RTAB-Map)

This repository contains launch files and instructions to bring up a four-wheel differential drive robot using ODrive motor controllers over CAN on Jetson Orin Nano. It supports camera integration and SLAM using RTAB-Map.

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

- Jetson Orin Nano with Ubuntu and ROS 2 (Foxy or Humble)
- ODrive configured for CAN communication
- A working ROS 2 workspace
- `odrive_botwheel_explorer` ROS 2 package
- Camera (e.g., OAK-D, RealSense)
- Teleop Twist Keyboard package

---

## 🔌 Step 1: Bring Up CAN Interface

To enable CAN communication with ODrive:

```bash
sudo ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 250000

    ✅ Make sure can0 is connected properly. You can verify using:

    ifconfig can0

🛞 Step 2: Launch ODrive Wheel Control

Start the ODrive motor control node:

ros2 launch odrive_botwheel_explorer botwheel_explorer.launch.py

When all wheels show green status in the terminal (CAN communication OK), you can run teleoperation to control the robot:

ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard

Use arrow keys or WASD keys to drive the robot.
🎥 Step 3: Launch Camera Node (Without URDF)

Start the camera node (e.g., OAK-D) without loading the robot's URDF model:

ros2 launch odrive_botwheel_explorer camera_as_a_part_of_robot.launch.py

Check image stream via:

ros2 topic list

🗺️ Step 4: Launch RTAB-Map SLAM
Option A: Full Test Launch (ODrive + SLAM)

ros2 launch odrive_botwheel_explorer test.launch.py

Option B: RTAB-Map SLAM Only

ros2 launch odrive_botwheel_explorer rtabmap.launch.py

    📍 Make sure odometry and camera topics are correctly remapped in the launch files for SLAM to work.

🧪 Optional Tools
Visualize with RViz:

rviz2

See Active Topics:

ros2 topic list

Record a ROS Bag:

ros2 bag record -a

📝 Notes

    If the robot doesn’t move, double-check the ODrive firmware, CAN wiring, and power supply.

    All motors must be calibrated and pre-configured with unique node IDs before launching.

    Customize launch files as per your robot’s physical configuration.
